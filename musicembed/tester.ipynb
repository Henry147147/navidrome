      "Description:\n",
      "This track is an energetic Indie Pop song that leans heavily into Electropop, blending bright synth‑driven pop melodies with the guitar‑based edge of indie rock.  The duration of the piece is 189.63 seconds.\n",
      "Tempo & Meter – The groove sits at ≈ 83 BPM in a steady 4/4 time‑signature, giving the piece a relaxed yet forward‑moving pulse.\n",
      "Key & Harmony – The tonal centre is D major. The chord list reveals a mixture of diatonic D‑major material (D, G, A, Bm) and several borrowed or chromatic chords (C♯, C♯maj7, Gm, Bb6, Cm, C#m7♭5/B, etc.). This harmonic palette creates a slightly wistful colour despite the major key, supporting the song’s bittersweet mood.\n",
      "Instrumentation & Production – The arrangement is built around a driving synth bass that anchors the low end, layered with bright, wide‑stereo synth pads and leads that add melodic sparkle. Electronic drums provide a crisp, punchy backbeat, while subtle electric‑guitar riffs add an organic texture. The mix is polished and modern: synths are panned for spaciousness, the bass is tight and prominent, and the overall mastering favours a clean, loud‑but‑dynamic sound that keeps the vocals front‑and‑centre.\n",
      "Vocal Characteristics – Lead vocals are performed by a female singer with a clear, slightly breathy timbre. She sings in a melodic pop style, using light reverb and subtle pitch‑correction that keep the performance polished without sounding over‑processed. The delivery is confident and assertive, matching the lyrical theme of self‑empowerment.\n",
      "Lyrical Themes – The lyrics revolve around independence, self‑worth, and rejecting materialistic expectations. The recurring chorus lines illustrate this stance:\n",
      "- “ We don’t care, we’re driving Cadillacs in our dreams ” – a metaphor for dreaming beyond material symbols.\n",
      "- “ We’ll never be royal, it’s a word in our blood ” – a declaration of staying true to oneself.\n",
      "- “ Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee ” – asserting personal power and leadership.\n",
      "These phrases are repeated throughout the track, reinforcing the empowering message.\n",
      "Song Structure & Dynamics – The composition follows a classic verse‑chorus form with a bridge and an extended outro. An intro of synth pads and bass sets the mood before the first verse. Each verse builds dynamically with added guitar texture, leading into a hook‑laden chorus where the synths open up and the vocal melody soars. A bridge introduces a slight harmonic shift (using chords such as C♯maj7 and Bb6) before returning to the final chorus and a prolonged outro that gradually strips back to synth pads, leaving a lingering sense of resolve.\n",
      "Overall Mood & Context – The track feels both empowering and slightly melancholic, pairing bright, dance‑able production with introspective lyrics. It sits comfortably within the 2020s indie‑pop landscape, where artists often fuse electronic polish with indie authenticity to create anthemic songs that speak to a generation focused on self‑definition and emotional honesty.\n",
      "Lyrics:\n",
      "**Verse 1**\n",
      "I've never seen a diamond in the flesh, I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies, and I'm not proud of my address in a torn up town, no postcode envy\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chorus**\n",
      "But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose dripping in the bathroom, bloodstains, ball gowns stretching the hotel room, we don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams, but everybody's like Crystal Maybach, diamonds on your time piece, jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash, we don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair, and we'll never be royal\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Chorus**\n",
      "It's a word in our blood, that kind of love's just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz, let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee, and baby I'll rule, let me live that fantasy\n",
      "\n",
      "**Verse 2**\n",
      "My friends in the eye with cracked the code, we count our dollars on the train to the party, and everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this, we didn't come from money\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chorus**\n",
      "But every song's like gold teeth grey goose dripping in the bathroom, blood stains, ball gowns stretching the hotel room, we don't carе, we're driving Cadillacs in our drеams, but everybody's like Crystal Maybach, diamonds on the time piece, jet planes, islands, tigers on the gold leash, we don't care, we aren't cut up in your love affair, and we'll never be Royal\n",
      "\n",
      "**Post-Chorus**\n",
      "It's a word in my blood, that kind of love's just ain't for me, I crave a different kind of buzz, let me be the ruler, you can call me queen bee, and baby, I'll rule, let me live that fantasy, we're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen\n",
      "\n",
      "**Outro**\n",
      "Life is great without a care, we aren't caught up in your love affair and we'll never be royal\n",
      "It's a word in our blood, that kind of loves just ain't for us, we crave a different kind a buzz, let me be your ruler, you can be my queen bee, and baby, I rule, let me live that fantasy\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "This track is a melancholic Indie Pop / Dream Pop piece that blends airy synth‑pad textures with subtle indie‑rock guitar work, creating an ethereal, introspective soundscape. Tempo & Meter – The song moves at ≈111 BPM in a steady 4/4 time signature. The duration of the piece is 236.39 seconds.\n",
      "Key – It is rooted in A♭ major, though the harmonic palette frequently dips into its relative minor (F minor) and other modal colors to sustain the wistful mood.\n",
      "Instrumentation & Production – The arrangement is built around lush, reverberant synth pads that fill the stereo field, a smooth synth bass that underpins the harmony, and clean electric‑guitar arpeggios that add delicate motion. A gentle electronic drum beat—soft kick, crisp hi‑hat, and subtle snare—provides a restrained rhythmic backbone. The mix is polished and spacious, with heavy use of reverb and delay on both instruments and vocals, giving the track a wide, dreamy ambience while keeping the low‑end tight through light compression.\n",
      "Vocal Characteristics – The lead is a female voice with a soft, breathy, ethereal timbre. She sings melodically and introspectively, often layered with harmonies that enhance the dreamy quality. Vocals are heavily processed with reverb and delay, creating a sense of distance and nostalgia, and are lightly compressed for consistency.\n",
      "Lyrical Themes – The lyrics explore memory, loss, and surreal, dream‑like imagery. Notable lines include:\n",
      "- “*I remember when your head caught flame*”\n",
      "- “*Explosions on TV and all the girls with heads inside a dream*”\n",
      "- “*We live beside the pool where everything is good*”\n",
      "- “*Shut my eyes to the sunlit place*”\n",
      "- “*I live in a hologram with you*”\n",
      "These phrases convey a yearning for past moments, an escapist fantasy, and a lingering sense of melancholy.\n",
      "Song Structure & Dynamics – The composition follows a clear verse‑chorus framework with instrumental breaks that heighten the atmospheric feel.\n",
      "- Intro: Opens with a wash of synth pads and a simple guitar arpeggio, establishing the tonal center.\n",
      "- Verse: Introduces the breathy vocal line over a progression that often moves Fm → Ab → C♯, emphasizing the minor‑major tension.\n",
      "- Pre‑chorus/Break: A brief instrumental lift adds a subtle drum fill and expands the pad texture.\n",
      "- Chorus: Shifts to a brighter harmonic region, frequently using Ab6 → C♯maj7 → Fm, which resolves the tension and lifts the emotional intensity while maintaining the dreamy vibe.\n",
      "- Bridge/Instrumental Break: Features a stripped‑back synth bass and guitar interplay, allowing the vocals to recede before returning to the final chorus.\n",
      "- Finale: Returns to the full arrangement, with layered vocal harmonies and a gradual fade of the pads, leaving a lingering sense of nostalgia.\n",
      "Theoretical Insight – The verse’s reliance on Fm (the relative minor) creates a searching, melancholic atmosphere, while the chorus’s move to Ab‑based chords (including Ab6 and C♯maj7) provides a subtle lift, offering a sense of release without abandoning the overall minor‑toned mood. The recurring C♯ chord functions as a pivot, linking the minor and major sections and reinforcing the track’s dreamy, slightly ambiguous tonal landscape.\n",
      "Overall Mood & Context – The song exudes a wistful, nostalgic aura, situating itself within the contemporary wave of indie‑pop that embraces dream‑pop aesthetics—think the late‑2010s to early‑2020s indie scene where reverb‑drenched vocals and synth‑laden arrangements dominate. Its blend of indie‑rock instrumentation with ambient electronic production creates a timeless, introspective listening experience that feels both personal and universally resonant.\n",
      "Lyrics:\n",
      "**Verse 1**\n",
      "I remember when your head caught flame, it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain. I remember when your head caught flame. Well you laughed baby it's okay. It's buzzcut season anyway. Well you laughed baby it's okay\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chorus**\n",
      "Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream, so now we live beside the pool where everything is good\n",
      "\n",
      "**Verse 2**\n",
      "We ride the bus with the knees pulled in. People should see how we're living. We ride the bus with the knees pulled in. Shut my eyes to the soft lip place. Sometimes this has a hot sweet taste. Shut my eyes to the soft lip place\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pre-Chorus**\n",
      "The men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose, but it's so easy in this blue where everything is good\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chorus**\n",
      "And I'll never go home again. Place the call, feel it start. Favorite friend. Nothing's wrong when nothing's true. I live in a hologram with you. We're all the things that we do for fun. And I'm leaving it all. Play along. Make believe it's hyperreal, but I live in a hologram with you\n",
      "\n",
      "**Verse 3**\n",
      "Cool with the burnt out taste. I'm the one you tell your fears to. There'll never be enough of us\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chorus**\n",
      "Explosions on TV and all the girls with heads inside a dream, so we live beside the pool where everything is good\n",
